# Clustering
This is a side project where I generate random data and cluster them
according to their position in a graph. 

## Requirements
The project was built using packages installed from 
[Anaconda 4.5.11](https://www.anaconda.com/download). The 
packages that were used can be found in `requirements.txt`.

## To-do
* Add uncertainty matrix and plot that
  * This needs to be per cluster.
